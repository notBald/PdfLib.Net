Pattern notes:

Step 1. Setup

-In this case it's a axial shading pattern
-Set up matrixes, clipping and AA.
-Fills optional backround color.

Step 2. Fill axial pattern

A. Get bounding box
 This is the box the drawing will go into. Just use the bounds
 feature on geomerty, perhaps with some matrix adjustment if
 needed.

 Can also set the clip to the bounding box

B. Then a bit of math:
 First compute delta x and delta y for the bounding box.

 Then compute tmin and tmax (t is the shading axis)
        dx * (xMin - x0) + dy * (ymin - y0)
 tmin = -----------------------------------
	                dx^2 * dy^2

 The formula is straight from the PDF specs, (page 194 in sumatra), 
 where x0 is from the coords array, xMin is from the clip and dx is
 "delta x" (Y is the same deal)

 Do this for each corner of the clip box. xmin, ymin is one corner
 xmin, ymax is the next corner, and so on.

 Then take the min/max t values and clip them to 0-1 depending on the
 Extend PdfArray.

C. First color calculation

 First calculate the color of tmin. This can be done later, but in
 any case use the formula for calculating T (given in the specs)
 and hand it over to the functions. 
 
 On the short term one can just set a color.

D. Then calc tx, ty coordinate for tmin
 
 Just multiply t with dx and dy calcled earlier

E. Intersection with BBox (Creating polygons)

 Then calc the intersection for the pendicular line on the t axis
 with the bounding box. Do this again for the next t, and together
 the intersection points form a polygon over an area to draw (with
 a single color)

F. Then move to the next region.

More notes:

-This is a sample based approach, some cleverness to how often to
 sample will probably speed up the algo.
-This means the geomety objects will either be rectangular, triangles
 or "almost" rectangles with endpoints squewed to the bounding box.
